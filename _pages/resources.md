### MCQLL Toolkits and software
Here are some of the pieces of software written by MCQLL members:

- [PolyglotDB](http://polyglotdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [The Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [SpeechCorpusTools](http://speech-corpus-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [AutoVOT](https://github.com/mlml/autovot)
- [Generalized Chart Parser](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11301)

### Toolkits and software we use
Some of our past projects have extensively used the following toolkits/programs:


- [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/)
- [HTK](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/)
- [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)
- [AMDTK](https://github.com/iondel/amdtk/wiki/How-To-Use)


### Programming languages
Most existing lab projects are written in [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Julia](https://www.julialang.org). Research tasks also often involve basic scripting in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). Lab members also have interest in [Scheme](https://www.schemers.org), [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org), and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).
