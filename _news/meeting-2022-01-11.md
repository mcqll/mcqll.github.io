- **{{ page.date | date: '%A, %B %-d' }}**, **15:00–16:00** (Montréal time, UTC-5).
- Meetings are via Zoom. If you would like to attend the talk but have not yet signed up for the MCQLL meetings this semester, please send an email to [mcqllmeetings@gmail.com](mailto:mcqllmeetings@gmail.com).

#### Abstract

<blockquote>
Grammatical gender is a highly statistically reliable cue to plural inflection class for German nouns, yet one that appears mainly disregarded by German speakers in wug inflection tasks. I will present some new experimental findings (work in progress) which shed light on this unexpected behavior.
