    __Title:__
    : What do Language Models Capture About Scope Ambiguities?

    __Abstract:__ 
    : > In recent years, language models (LMs) have achieved human-like performance on a range of tasks designed to test natural language understanding (NLU). Their high performance on NLU tasks has led to claims of these models ‘understanding’ natural language; as a result of the methods by which they are trained, however, little is known about the actual linguistic structures they induce. In this talk, I present ongoing work aimed at investigating the manner in which LMs capture a specific semantic phenomenon: scope ambiguity. Focusing on scope ambiguities generated by quantifiers, negation, modality, quantificational adverbs and intensional verbs, I will cover the results of an experiment conducted on language models and humans, and discuss future experiments aimed at answering the same question.
