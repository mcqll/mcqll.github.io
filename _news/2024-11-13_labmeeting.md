-  __Speaker:__
    : Amanda Doucette

    __Title:__
    : Causal Discovery in the Lexicon: Data, Conditional Independence, and Missingness

    __Abstract:__ 
    : > In this talk, I will present some of my recent work on the causal structure of frequency, word length, phonotactic complexity, and morphological irregularity in the lexicon. First, I will discuss how grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) methods can be used to extract IPA lexicons from Wikipedia. Then, I will cover some of the challenges in applying causal discovery to real data: conditional independence testing and handling missing data.
