    __Title:__
    : Do aspectual classes show up in corpus distribution patterns?

    __Abstract:__ 
    : > Verbs fall into distinct aspectual classes, as supported by a wide array of linguistic judgment tests. I expect strong grammaticality and felicity judgments to be correlated with widespread tendencies in usage which will be discoverable from a corpus. I present my plans to investigate whether the empirical distribution of verbs in an English corpus reflects their aspectual classification, or something else related. I will describe the broad patterns in my corpus data and the modeling approaches that I hope will bring to light additional patterns.
