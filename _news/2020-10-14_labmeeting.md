#### Abstract

<blockquote>
	In this talk, Prof. Tapp will present some recent breakthroughs in discrete word representations based on language models. He will show that using an appropriate cost function minimisation in deep learning, one can learn word embeddings with discrete features that have impressive semantic relevance.
