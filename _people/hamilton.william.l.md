I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at McGill University and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at the Mila AI Institute of Quebec. I develop machine learning models that can reason about our complex, interconnected world.

Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, network science, and natural language processing, with a current emphasis on the fast-growing subjects of *graph representation learning* and *graph neural networks*.
