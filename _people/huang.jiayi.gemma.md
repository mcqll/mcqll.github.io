I am a fourth-year undergraduate in the Honours Linguistics program with a Computer Science minor at McGill University. I am interested in Acoustic Phonetics, computational phonology and using quantitative methods for linguistic data analysis. My current project involves testing different probabilistic models of English phonotactics.
