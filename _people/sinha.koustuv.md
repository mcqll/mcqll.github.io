I am a PhD candidate affiliated with
[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/koustuv-sinha/) and [Reasoning and Learning
Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University. I am co-supervised by Profs
Joelle Pineau, and William Hamilton and collaborate with Prof [Timothy
O'Donnell](/people/odonnell.timothy). My primary research interests are
Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems) and Language Reasoning. I am also
interested in exploring strong linguistic priors in designing machine learning
systems for text generation and representation.
