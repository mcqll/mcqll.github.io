I'm a postdoctoral fellow working with professors Timothy J. O'Donnell and Siva Reddy. I completed my Ph.D. in computational/cognitive linguistics at Stanford University, where I was co-advised by Mike C. Frank and Dan Jurafsky. My research intersects computational modeling and language acquisition, though I have also dabbled in theoretical syntax and digital humanities.
