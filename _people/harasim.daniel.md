I am a PhD candidate in digital musicology at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) where I work with my thesis supervisors Martin Rohrmeier (EPFL) and Timothy O’Donnell (McGill University). I work on the topics of generative modelling of musical structures, combining methods from music theory, mathematical modelling, computer linguistics, and Bayesian statistics. In 2015, I earned a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science at the TU Dresden where I in particular worked on geometric structures of voice-leading spaces. My research interests further include topics from mathematical music theory, music cognition, and the application of Schenkerian Analysis to Jazz. Aside from my academic activities, I enjoy playing the upright bass in Jazz improvisations.
