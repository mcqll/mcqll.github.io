I am currently an MSc student at [Mcgill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), focusing on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.  My research interests include computational morphology, computational phonology, and the application of machine learning techniques to linguistic problems.
