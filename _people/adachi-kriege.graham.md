I am in my fourth year majoring in Cognitive Science with a focus in computer science and a minor in linguistics. I am most interested in semantics in natural language processing, including sentiment analysis, word sense disambiguation, and topic modeling. I am currently working on making a list of millions of potential words based on English phonotactics, giving regular and irregular inflections of those forms, and testing native English speaker judgments on those inflections to observe patterns that occur in making irregular and regular inflections on novel words.
