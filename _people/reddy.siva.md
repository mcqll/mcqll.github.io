I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/) at McGill University. 

My research goal is to enable machines with natural language understanding abilities such that conversing with machines feels as natural as conversing with humans. Along this process, I hope to discover fundamental representations of language, both symbolic and distributional, that allow us to study the connections between language and meaning. My expertise includes building symbolic (linguistic and induced) and deep learning models for language understanding. In the space of linguistics, I am interested in developing formal models for language (type-theoretical syntax-semantics interfaces) and in interpreting how deep neural networks represent linguistic phenomena.
