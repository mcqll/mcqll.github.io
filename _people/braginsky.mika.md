I’m a graduate student in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.
I’m interested in how children learn the meanings and structures of their native language, especially from the perspective of examining language in its social and cultural context. My approach focuses on analyses of large-scale survey and corpus data, as well as Bayesian computational models. I also work on tools to help research in the field be more scalable, reproducible, and open.
