I am an assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science at McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/).

My group conducts research in natural language processing (NLP), an area of artificial intelligence in which we build computational models of human languages such as English or French. The goal of our research is to develop computational methods for understanding text and speech, in order to generate language that is fluent and appropriate to the context.

In our lab, we investigate statistical machine learning techniques for analyzing and making predictions about language. Several current projects include summarizing fiction, extracting events from text, and adapting language across genres.

Research interests:

Natural language processing
Computational semantics
Natural language generation
Automatic summarization
